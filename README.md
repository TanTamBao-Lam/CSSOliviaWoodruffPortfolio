# Olivia Woodruff Portfolio
In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of CSS visual rules to create rule sets and improve the appearance of a photography portfolio site!

## Tasks
1. Look over **index.html** to review the different HTML elements you have to work with, then navigate to **style.css**.
Start by making the header section stand out a bit more. Select the `.header` element, and make its background color _CornflowerBlue_ by using the `background-color` property.

2. Now change how the text is aligned in the top `.header` section.
In your `.header` rule set, align the text in the _center_ using the `text-align` property.

3. Next, use CSS to make the paragraph below Olivia’s name have a larger text size.
In **style.css**, select the `.about-me` element, and set its `font-size` property to _20px_.

4. The `.about-me` paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the background.
Within the `.about-me` selector, use the `opacity` property to make it _50% transparent_.

5. In the Projects section, make the section titles bold.
Select the `.title` elements, and add a `font-weight` property to make their text _bold_.

6. Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more nicely. Set the `color` for `h1` elements to _Azure_.

7. Instead of the page being in the default Times font, change the font of the entire page.
Select the `body` element and make the `font-family` of the page _Georgia_.

8. Finally, let’s make the background of the page more interesting.
Within the `body` selector, set the `background-image` property to this URL:

9. Great work! Feel free to keep coding and edit the visual rules to personalize the site’s appearance!
